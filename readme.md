# Westminster Tweet Analysis

An analysis of Twitter habits of the 2017 cohort of British MPs.

The analysis looked at over 2.7 million tweets scraped from MP's public Twitter profiles.


## Introduction

This repository contains an analysis of the how current British MPs use Twitter. The analysis is split into several sections:

### General Analysis

Ask questions like:

* Which MP's have the most followers?

* What time do MP's tweet? Does this affect how many interactions they get?

* Which parties are most popular on Twitter?

* How has the Twitter behaviour of MPs changed over time?

* Which MPs follow which other MPs?

### Natural Language Processing

* How does the language used differ between the political parties?

* How does tweet setiment change over time? Which MPs or parties are the most positive or negative?

## Datasets

Several datasets were compiled for this project. They were compiled December 2017.

1. A Tweet dataset. This dataset was built by scraping all the tweets from MPs with Twitter accounts. It is possible some MPs were missed.

2. A Twitter profile dataset. A dataset containing the profile information from MPs e.g. follower count, bio.

3. A Following dataset. All the other Twitter users that an MP follows.
